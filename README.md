# Dynamic-two-dimensional-array

Be able to dynamically allocate and release memory using pointers for 2D dynamic arrays. 
Instructions
This program fills and prints out the board. 

The steps are:

Declare an int** variable named board which will be used for dynamical array;
Declare two int variables row and column.
Prompt user to enter the values of row and column;
Dynamically allocates a two-dimensional array large enough to hold that row*column values;
Prompt users to enter the values for the board.
Print out the board.
Release memory
